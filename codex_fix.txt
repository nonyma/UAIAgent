The error message:

```
No target name was specified on the command-line.
```

indicates that you're attempting to build the Unreal project `UAIAGent` without specifying a target configuration, such as `Development`, `Debug`, etc., or without specifying the correct command to build the project.

### How to Fix

#### 1. **Use UnrealEditor or UnrealBuildTool with the correct target**

You need to specify your target explicitly when building via command line.

**Example build commands:**

```bash
# To build the project using UnrealEditor:
"[PathToUnrealEditor]\UnrealEditor.exe" "PathToYourProject\UAIAGent.uproject" -Target=UAIAGentEditor -TargetPlatform=Win64 -build

# Or use UnrealBuildTool (UBT) explicitly:
"C:\Path\To\UnrealBuildTool.exe" -Target=UAIAGentEditor Win64 Development -Project="C:\Path\To\Your\Project\UAIAGent.uproject"
```

Replace `[PathToUnrealEditor]`, `PathToYourProject`, and the target names as appropriate.

#### 2. **If building from within Visual Studio**

Open the generated Visual Studio solution (`UAIAGent.sln`) inside the `UAIAGent` project folder.

- Set the build configuration to `Development Editor`.
- Set the platform to `Win64`.
- Build or run your project from Visual Studio.

---

#### 3. **Check Your Build Command or Batch Script**

If you're running a batch script or command line, ensure it includes the target:

```bash
RunUAT.bat BuildCookRun -project="Path\To\UAIAGent.uproject" -noP4 -build -target=UAIAGentEditor -platform=Win64 -client
```

---

### Summary

- You *must* specify the target (e.g., `UAIAGentEditor`) when building.
- Use Unrealâ€™s build tools with correct parameters or build directly in Visual Studio.
- Ensure your command looks like:

```bash
"Path\To\UnrealBuildTool.exe" -Target=UAIAGentEditor Win64 Development -Project="Path\To\UAIAGent.uproject"
```

### Additional Tips:
- If you haven't created a custom target, the default is usually `UAIAGentEditor` or `UAIAGent`.

If you'd like, share the exact command you're executing or your build script, and I can help craft the precise fix!
