The error message indicates that the build failed because no target name was specified on the command line. This generally means you attempted to build your Unreal project without providing a valid target (e.g., Editor, Game, or a specific module).

### Common Causes:
- Running `UnrealBuildTool` directly without specifying the target.
- Incorrect command line syntax.
- Missing or misconfigured project files.

### Typical Solution:
Ensure you're specifying the correct target and platform when building your project.

### How to fix it:

#### 1. Use UnrealBuildTool with a proper command:
Instead of running:

```bash
UnrealBuildTool
```

You should specify the target, platform, and configuration:

```bash
UnrealBuildTool -Target="UAIAGentEditor" Win64 Development -Project="Path/To/Your/Project/UAIAGent.uproject"
```

OR, using the command in the Unreal Engine Editor:

```bash
"Path/To/UE4Editor-Cmd.exe" "Path/To/Your/Project/UAIAGent.uproject" -run=UEBuildCookRun -target=UAIAGentEditor -TargetPlatform=Win64 -Configuration=Development
```

#### 2. Building from Visual Studio (recommended):

- Right-click your project/solution and select **Build** or **Rebuild**.
- Ensure your startup project is set correctly.

#### 3. Using Unreal Editor:

Open your project in Unreal Editor, then:
- File > Package Project > SQL based on your target platform.

### Additional Tips:
- Check your project's `/Source` directory for correct module definitions.
- If you use command line, always specify `-Target=""`.

### Example of a command to build the game target:

```bash
"Path/To/UE4Editor-Cmd.exe" "Path/To/Your/Project/UAIAGent.uproject" -run=UnrealBuildTool -Target=UAIAGent -Platform=Win64 -Configuration=Development
```

### Final note:
If you're testing or building in command line, always check the official UE documentation for your specific engine version, as commands may vary slightly.

---

### Summary:
- Always specify a target name.
- Use the correct command syntax.
- Prefer building via Visual Studio or UE Editor for simplicity.
